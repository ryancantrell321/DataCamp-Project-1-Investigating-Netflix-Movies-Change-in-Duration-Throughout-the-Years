# DataCamp Project-1:
## Investigating Netflix Movies' Change in Duration Throughout the Years

Welcome to my repository! This project is a part of my learning journey of Data Science in Python with DataCamp. In this project, I have applied the foundational Python skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python by manipulating and visualizing movie and TV data. These foundational skills include several analytical modules of python such as Numpy Arrays, Matplotlib Plots, and Pandas Data Analysis Library. 

Mostly, in this project, I used several data analysis and manipulation techniques such as plottings, loopings, DataFrame filterings, etc on a Kaggle dataset file to investigate whether or not movies in netflix are getting shorter or longer over time. My analysis revealed that the durations experienced an increase every year with occassional fluctuations.

This project helped me gain experience in an essential data science skill â€” exploratory data analysis through visualization. This allowed me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I created of the data.
